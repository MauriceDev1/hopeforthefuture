            <p className='text-xl'>Hope for the Future was founded in 2002.
              My so was, diagnosed with ADD at the age of 6. By the age of 8 he was diagnosed with ADHD.
              It was completely foreign to me. I then educated myself to understand what it meant and needed to understand the support I had to give him.
              I had to change he&apos;s, diet and realised my, son&apos;s future was in my hands.
              Even though my son was academically sound he still had a learning disability.
              After finding out my son was being marginalized, excluded and teachers were not being honest about he&apos;s progress and they used to tell me what I wanted to hear in stead of being honest.
              After sitting with him and he&apos;s reading I realized my son picked up a brilliant skill to memorize he&apos;s reading.
              After understanding he&apos;s needs I removed him without permission or a referral from he&apos;s primary school and placed him at a school fitting for he&apos;s needs.
              My son today is a very intelligent young man and is a qualified Optic Fibre technician and DATA cable specialist.</p>
